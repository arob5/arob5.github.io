I"¤<p>In this post I provide an overview of the filtering problem for discrete stochastic
dynamical systems, which is nicely cast as a problem of Bayesian inference.
In short, the problem we are trying to solve is as follows: suppose we are trying
to predict the state of a dynamical process which evolves over time. For example,
the process could be the global climate system and the state could be the
temperature at some fixed locations. Suppose we have a model for the system of
interest, which is stochastic in nature; the randomness might be inherant to the
system under study or might come from uncertainties stemming from our lack of
understanding of the dynamics. We could thus step our model forward in time to
try to predict the true state of the system. However, suppose we have a second
source of information: measurements of the process. Just like the dynamics, the
observations are subject to noise, which in this case typically represents some
sort of measurement error. The filtering problem seeks to combine these two
imperfect sources of information to produce an estimate of the true state, as
well as an estimate of the uncertainty. This will be made precise below.</p>
