## About Me

I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Computing and Data Sciences at Boston University (BU), working with
[Jonathan Huggins](http://jhhuggins.org/) and [Michael Dietze](https://www.bu.edu/earth/profiles/michael-dietze/).
I am broadly interested in uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inverse problems, data assimilation, and
spatiotemporal statistics, with the goal of developing new methodologies for environmental and ecological applications.
My current work involves developing Bayesian methods for calibrating expensive mechanistic models of the terrestrial carbon
cycle.

Beyond my research, I am a trainee in [BU URBAN](https://sites.bu.edu/urban/),
a graduate program in urban biogeoscience and environmental health. I am also
an officer in the [BU chapter](https://www.bu.edu/math/bu-student-chapter-of-the-asa/)
of the American Statistical Association, and previously co-organized the
Environment and Climate [working group](https://www.md4sg.com/workinggroups/environment.html)
within the [Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)](https://www.md4sg.com/index.html)
research intitiative.

Prior to BU, I worked as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston. I received my B.S. in Quantitative Economics from Tufts University
in 2018.
