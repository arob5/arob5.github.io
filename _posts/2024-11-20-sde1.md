Plan:
- Motivate as ODEs + noise (include example: noise entering via parameters, see Klebaner; noise entering as stochastic forcing, see Saarka) (also see Saarka)
- Emphasize the solution is a stochastic process.
- Integral form of ODEs and how to translate this to SDEs (see Saarka); this
heuristic approach is valid only for linear SDEs.
- Section on moving from stochastic difference equations to SDEs via continuous time limits (see Reich and Cotter)
- Discuss difficulties in making this all rigorous
