## Facts to derive
- GP mean interpolates design points.
- Nugget breaks interpolation.
- GP mean reverts to prior far away from design points (under what
  conditions on kernel?)
- GP kernel reverts to prior far away from design points (under what conditions?)
- Conditional GP variance is smaller than prior variance.
