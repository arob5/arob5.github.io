## Preliminaries
{% katexmm %}
Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Throughout this post,
we write $\langle x, y \rangle = x^\top y$ for the standard
inner product on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\lVert x \rVert_2 = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}$
the norm induced by this inner product. We will frequently consider linear
functions of the form $\ell: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, and denote the set
of all such functions as $(\mathbb{R}^n)^*$. Every
$\ell \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ can be uniquely represented as an inner product
with some vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. When we wish to make this identification
explicit, we will write $\ell_y$ to denote the linear map given by
$\ell_y(x) = \langle x, y \rangle$. Likewise, if we are working with a generic
linear map $\ell \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$, then we will write $y_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
to denote the unique vector satisfying $\ell(x) = \langle x, y_{\ell} \rangle$.
We will also loosely refer to $\ell_y(x)$ as a *projection* onto $y$.
Note that if $y$ has unit norm, then this is precisely the magnitude of the
orthogonal projection of $x$ onto $y$.

## Sigma Algebra
{% katexmm %}
We recall from the previous post that a univariate Gaussian measure is defined
on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$. Analogously, we
will define an $n$-dimensional Gaussian measure on the Borel sets
$\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. There are two reasonable approaches
to define $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and I want to take a moment to highlight
them since the same two options will present themselves when we consider
defining the Borel sets over infinite-dimensional spaces.

### Option 1: Leverage the Standard Topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$
A Borel $\sigma$-algebra can be defined for any space that comes equipped with
a topology; i.e., a collection of open sets. The Borel $\sigma$-algebra is then
defined as the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains all of these open sets.
In the present setting, this means
$$
\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)
:= \sigma\left\{\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n : \mathcal{O} \text{ is open} \right\}, \tag{1}
$$
where $\sigma(\mathcal{S})$ denotes the $\sigma$-algebra generated by a collection
of sets $\mathcal{S}$. A nice perspective on $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is
that it is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that ensures all continuous
functions $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ are measurable. We note that this is
*not* a property of Borel $\sigma$-algebras more generally, but one
that does hold in the special case of $\mathbb{R}^n$; see
[this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3952771/borel-sigma-algebra-and-measurability-of-continuous-functions?rq=1) StackExchange post for some details.


### Option 2: Product of One-Dimensional Borel Sets
A second reasonable approach is to try extending what we have already defined
in one dimension, which means simply taking Cartesian products of one-dimensional
Borel sets:
$$
\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)
:= \sigma\left\{B_1 \times \cdots \times B_n: B_i \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}), \ i = 1, \dots, n \right\}. \tag{2}
$$
It turns out that the resulting $\sigma$-algebra agrees with that defined
in option 1, so there is no ambiguity in the notation.

## Definition: One-Dimensional Projections
{% katexmm %}
With the $\sigma$-algebra defined, we now consider how to define a Gaussian
measure $\mu$ on the measurable space $(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))$.
We will explore a few different equivalent definitions, starting with this:
a measure is Gaussian if all of its one-dimensional projections are
(univariate) Gaussians.
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition.</strong>
  A probability measure $\mu$ defined on the Borel measurable space
  $(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))$ is called <strong>Gaussian</strong>
  if, for all linear maps $\ell \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$, the pushforward measure
  $\mu \circ \ell^{-1}$ is Gaussian on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$.
  </p>
</blockquote>

As in the univariate setting, we define a random variable $X$ as Gaussian
if its law $X$ is a Gaussian measure. Recall that each linear map $\ell$
can be identified with a unique $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that
$\ell(x) = \langle x, y \rangle$, which we indicate by writing
$\ell_y = \ell$. We thus see that $\mu \circ \ell_{y}^{-1}$ is the
distribution of the random variable $\langle X, y \rangle$. The previous
definition can therefore be re-stated in the language of random variables
as follows: an $n$-dimensional random variable is Gaussian if every linear
combination of the entries of $X$ is univariate Gaussian. More precisely:
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition.</strong>
  Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ be a a probability space and
  $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$ a random variable. Then $X$ is called
  <strong>Gaussian</strong> if $\langle X, y \rangle$ is a univariate Gaussian
  random variable for all $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
  </p>
</blockquote>
{% endkatexmm %}

## Fourier Transform
{% katexmm %}
Just as in the univariate case, the Fourier transform $\hat{\mu}$ provides
an alternate, equivalent, characterization of Gaussian measures. First, we
recall how such a Fourier transform is defined in the multiple variable
setting.
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition.</strong>
  Let $\mu$ be a measure on $(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))$.
  Then the Fourier transform of $\mu$ is defined as
  $$
  \hat{\mu}(y) := \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{i\langle x, y\rangle} \mu(dx),
  \qquad y \in \mathbb{R}^n \tag{3}
  $$
  </p>
</blockquote>
We can alternatively view $\hat{\mu}$ as a function of
$\ell_y \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$;
that is,
$$
\ell_y \mapsto \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{i \ell_y(x)} \mu(dx).
$$
Note that this is similar in spirit to the definition of the $n$-dimensional
Gaussian measure, in the sense that the extension from one to multiple
dimensions is acheived by considering one-dimensional linear projections.
This idea will also provide the basis for an extension to infinite dimensions.

With this background established, we can state the following, which gives
an alternate definition of Gaussian measures.
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem.</strong>
  A probability measure $\mu$ defined on the Borel measurable space
  $(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))$ is Gaussian if and only
  if its Fourier transform is of the form
  $$
  \hat{\mu}(y) = \exp\left\{i\langle m, y\rangle - \frac{1}{2}\langle Cy, y\rangle \right\}, \tag{4}
  $$
  for some fixed vector $m \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and symmetric, positive
  semi-definite matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Proof.**

## Density Function

## Transformation of Standard Gaussian Random Variables
In this section we provide yet another characterization of Gaussian measures.
We consider a *generative* perspective, whereby a Gaussian random vector
$X \in \mathbb{R}^n$ arises via a linear transformation of $n$ iid
$\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ random variables.
