## Preliminaries
{% katexmm %}
Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Throughout this post,
we write $\langle x, y \rangle = x^\top y$ for the standard
inner product on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\lVert x \rVert_2 = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}$
the norm induced by this inner product. We will frequently consider linear
functions of the form $\ell: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, and denote the set
of all such functions as $(\mathbb{R}^n)^*$. Every
$\ell \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ can be uniquely represented as an inner product
with some vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. When we wish to make this identification
explicit, we will write $\ell_y$ to denote the linear map given by
$\ell_y(x) = \langle x, y \rangle$. Likewise, if we are working with a generic
linear map $\ell \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$, then we will write $y_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
to denote the unique vector satisfying $\ell(x) = \langle x, y_{\ell} \rangle$.
We will also loosely refer to $\ell_y(x)$ as a *projection* onto $y$.
Note that if $y$ has unit norm, then this is precisely the magnitude of the
orthogonal projection of $x$ onto $y$.

## Sigma Algebra
{% katexmm %}
We recall from the previous post that a univariate Gaussian measure is defined
on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$. Analogously, we
will define an $n$-dimensional Gaussian measure on the Borel sets
$\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. There are two reasonable approaches
to define $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and I want to take a moment to highlight
them since the same two options will present themselves when we consider
defining the Borel sets over infinite-dimensional spaces.

### Option 1: Leverage the Standard Topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$
A Borel $\sigma$-algebra can be defined for any space that comes equipped with
a topology; i.e., a collection of open sets. The Borel $\sigma$-algebra is then
defined as the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains all of these open sets.
In the present setting, this means
$$
\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)
:= \sigma\left\{\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n : \mathcal{O} \text{ is open} \right\},
$$
where $\sigma(\mathcal{S})$ denotes the $\sigma$-algebra generated by a collection
of sets $\mathcal{S}$. A nice perspective on $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is
that it is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that ensures all continuous
functions $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ are measurable. We note that this is
*not* a property of Borel $\sigma$-algebras more generally, but one
that does hold in the special case of $\mathbb{R}^n$; see
[this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3952771/borel-sigma-algebra-and-measurability-of-continuous-functions?rq=1) StackExchange post for some details.


### Option 2: Product of One-Dimensional Borel Sets
A second reasonable approach is to try extending what we have already defined
in one dimension, which means simply taking Cartesian products of one-dimensional
Borel sets:
$$
\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)
:= \sigma\left\{B_1 \times \cdots \times B_n: B_i \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}), \ i = 1, \dots, n \right\}.
$$
It turns out that the resulting $\sigma$-algebra agrees with that defined
in option 1, so there is no ambiguity in the notation.
